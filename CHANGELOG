# These are the major changes and updates. For build specific changes (which are too numerous to document manually), check the commits on github.

03.01.2023, version 3.1.1:
- Added better checkpointing so reads aren't always re-mapped with `-resume` set
- Fixed the default filter string to used bcftools' updated syntax (e.g. `~` instead of `=` for inexact matches); see: https://github.com/samtools/bcftools/releases/tag/1.11

08.13.2020, version 3.1:
- Restructured code to add modularity for easy incorporation of other read mappers or variant callers
- Now uses HaplotypeCaller from GATK4 for variant calling
- Now uses bcftools to generate the final consensus FASTA file, which allows the incorporation of indels and generates a chain file to preserve coordinate system from original reference

# PREVIOUS:
# Version beta 2.1: December 09, 2019
- Restructure of code from previous versions
- Implemented split variant calling by scaffold to make HaplotypeCaller feasible
- Use bcftools consensus for final sequence to incorporate indels

# TODO:

# IN DEVELOPMENT:
- Need a better way to specify read groups for mapping
- snakemake
